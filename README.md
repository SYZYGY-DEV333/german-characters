# German Charactes
Copies selected character (umlauts, etc.) to clipboard for easy use.

Written in Go using the Clipboard Library by Atotto, and the UI library by Andlabs.

I use this for High School German projects. It's badly written (took about an hour), but it works.

Requires XClip on Linux. Should work fine on OS X and Windows, although I haven't tested it.
